In this project, I worked on implementing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. While I was provided with basic code structures, I created the reinforcement learning algorithm and neural network model to enable the agent to learn and make decisions in a complex environment.

Computer scientists solve problems across various domains by developing algorithms, designing systems, and writing code. We approach problems systematically, breaking them down and devising strategies to tackle them effectively, often collaborating in interdisciplinary teams.

Ethically, computer scientists must consider the impact of their work on end users and society. This includes ensuring privacy, security, and fairness in algorithms and systems, as well as mitigating biases and unintended consequences. Transparency and accountability are crucial, particularly in developing technologies with significant societal implications like AI and machine learning systems.
